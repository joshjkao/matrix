# matrix

This is the start of a project that implements a matrix class and some helpful related math functions such as matrix multiplication and linear equation solving.
The current version includes all the necessary functions to drive a simple physics engine that I am developing as a project for PHYS 304: Advanced Mechanics, but I hope that once I can tune it farther it can also be used for my Minesweeper project (visible under my repositories) and work-in-progress 2D puzzle platformer.
